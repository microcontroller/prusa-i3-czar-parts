prusa-i3-czar-parts
===================

Improved and additional parts for the Prusa i3 kit from 3dprinterczar.com
These parts may also be useful on other Prusa i3 variants, or even on other printers.
Where possible, I use OpenSCAD to generate easily modifiable parts. Some of these
parts make use of the MCAD library.
